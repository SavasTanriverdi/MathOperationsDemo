# MathOperationsDemo

This Java project showcases how to use basic mathematical operators, as well as increment and decrement operators. It covers arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and the proper use of the `++` and `--` operators.

## Key Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus)
- Demonstrating the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators
- Pre-increment vs post-increment usage
- Pre-decrement vs post-decrement usage

## Usage:
Run the main class to see the results of the mathematical operations and increment/decrement demonstrations.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
